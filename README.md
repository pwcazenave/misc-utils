==========

Miscellaneous tools I've written for doing useful things.

* fix_case.py - Changes file name case from all lower case to Proper Case. Also removes underscores from names.
* photogo.sh - Copies photos to a designated directory with a consistent directory structure.
* backup.sh - Script I run through cron to backup certain directories to an external disk. Also archives permissions for each file and directory on the root partition.
